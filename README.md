## Fundementals
### Must be in Place to Pass
1. Names, Objects, and Assignment
2. Basic Structures (For-Loop, While-Loop, If-Statements)
3. Basic Lists (Iterating Over, Growing)
4. Basic Plotting
6. Importing Modules and Basic Usage
5. Functions (Using Existing, Creating Custom)

### Need to Ensure
1. Tests and Exams Outcomes --> Only pass when above points are in place
2. Teaching Outcomes --> Align with the fundementals
3. Tutorials Outcomes --> Align with the fundementals
4. Basic and advanced / extra outcomes --> Make sure that advanced / extra
    outcomes do not interfere with basic outcomes - when in doubt throw it out!
